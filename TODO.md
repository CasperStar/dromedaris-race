# Improvements

Using the issue tracker wouls be kind of overkill for a small hobby project. The following bulletpoint list shows improvements that still can be done.

- Add MotorController code for the ATMega328P
- Capture all dependencies in pip
- Add statically typed in python where possible
- Improve technical documentation
- Add PCB schematic to the hardware documentation
- Add testing / mocking to test without required hardware
- Add correct packaging / folder structure for a python project
- Add SonarCloud when repo is public
